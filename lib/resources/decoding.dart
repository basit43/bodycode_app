  Explanation
Tendons are found at the ends of every muscle in the body and attach the muscles to their bony attachment points.

If you have been guided to this page by the subconscious mind through testing, it indicates a misalignment is present. Remember that most of the time, misalignments are caused by the distorting effect of some associated imbalance such as a trapped emotion. 

Decoding
It may be necessary to determine the tendon that is misaligned. 

Ask: Is it necessary to identify more about this misalignment?

● If no, continue to Association.
● If yes, use a process of elimination to determine the approximate location of the tendon. 
○ First, if there is discomfort present in some part of the body, and you are trying to address that part of the body at the moment, it's likely that the tendon in question is in that area. 
○ If you don't have any idea where this tendon misalignment might be, you might start by asking if it is in the upper body, or the lower body, then the left side of the body or the right side of the body, continuing in this way until you have identified an area.''';
