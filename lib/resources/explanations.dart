  Air pollution here refers to solid particles and gases in the air, either indoor or outdoor. Air pollution can be highly toxic to our bodies, environment and food supply, both in the short-term and long-term.  

● Sources could include:
○ Burning of wood, tobacco, coal, trash, and fossil fuels
○ Biological materials such as mold or pollen
○ Gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, chemical vapors, and exhaust
Dioxins
● Toxins may be from any time or point in your life.
● Toxins can exist in physical form, as well as in an invisible, energetic form. Energetic toxins are vibrational frequencies that were simply unable to be processed, likely because the energy body was imbalanced.''';

  Water pollution refers to toxins in the water that we drink and bathe in, as well as the water that helps to grow our food supply. Water pollution can be highly toxic to all life, both in the short-term and long-term.  

● Water has the ability to hold a vibrational frequency or “memory” of certain contaminants. This is one reason that you may find other toxins that you are confident you’ve never been exposed to. 
● Contaminants could include:
○ Agricultural runoff
○ Fluoride

      '''This is a type of energy that develops when the body’s recovery process (from minor to severe injury or illness) is interrupted, and the body is unable to return to a balanced state.
      ■ Having a recovery interference energy could potentially interfere with normal body processes, and could create frustrating symptoms including:
      ● Chronic or recurring inflammation
      ● Scar tissue
      ● Muscle spasms
      ■ It is important to note that releasing recovery interference energy may potentially encourage the body to initiate a healing process all over again. One result of this could include inflammation, which is generally a normal and important process, as long as it is short-term and is not interrupted.''';

  static const String physicalIntoleranceExp =
      '''Physical intolerances may manifest if the body comes in contact with a substance that it has trouble processing, usually because the body is already imbalanced or stressed, and is therefore less able to digest or otherwise process the substance. 
■ It is possible to have an intolerance to anything at all, but most commonly, intolerances are from foods and drinks, as well as cosmetics such as lotions and perfumes.
■ The subconscious mind manifests the symptoms of physical intolerance as a way to communicate that the body is imbalanced and is in need of help.
■ Symptoms may include fatigue, extreme or sudden sleepiness, headaches, skin issues, digestive discomfort and bloating.

  static const String idealAllergyExp =
      '''Idea allergies are generally created when the subconscious mind makes a faulty or negative connection with a particular idea (any thought, emotion, concept, event, action, person, place or thing). This usually happens during either prolonged or sudden emotional and/or physical stress. This idea then is considered to be a problem by the subconscious, and a negative response or reaction of some kind will occur when this idea is encountered or could be encountered in the future.
■ The subconscious mind may create an idea allergy as a protective measure, in order to defend you from the stress that it has connected with the idea, and to prevent the stressful past from being repeated. For this reason, you can become allergic to anything at all. 
■ Symptoms may range from subtle to extreme: self-sabotage, emotional reactivity, avoidance, phobias, and even stress-related physical symptoms. The subconscious mind may generate any kind of symptom in an attempt to avoid proximity to this idea.
■ Idea allergies nearly always have associated imbalances such as trapped emotions that must be cleared in order to reset and neutralize the subconscious mind’s response to the idea.
■ It is common to have a physical allergy to any kind of substance associated with the idea allergy. (e.g. if you have an idea allergy to your marriage, you may develop a physical allergy to your partner’s perfume).

■ The subconscious mind may create a physical allergy as a protective measure, in order to defend you from the stress that it has connected with the allergen. For this reason, you can become allergic to anything at all. 
■ Symptoms may include physical reactions of all kinds as well as immune reactions such as inflammation, respiratory problems, congestion, sinus irritation, itchy eyes, and other forms of hypersensitivity. 
■ Physical allergies nearly always have associated imbalances such as trapped emotions that must be cleared in order to reset the subconscious response to the allergen.
■ It is common to have both a physical allergy and an idea allergy to the same allergen.

  static const String curseExp =
      '''A curse is a strong negative energy that either comes from an entity, from another person, or from your own subconscious mind. Curses are generally intended to block, sabotage or interfere with the recipient’s life, healing, connection to the Divine or actions in some way. 
■ A curse is similar to any other emotional energy, such as a trapped emotion, in that it consists of energy lodged within the energy field of the body.
■ Curses may be created by the subconscious mind and could simply be the expression of negative feelings toward the recipient. 
■ Curses may also be deliberate, consciously created with an intention to achieve a certain (often nefarious) purpose. 
■ When decoding, you may or may not need to identify more about the curse and what its intention was. If you do need to decode the intention, consider the goal you are working toward in your session— that may provide a helpful clue in decoding, in addition to the prompts below.

  static const String cordingExp =
      '''■ Cords are inherently negative, direct connections between two people. 
■ Cords can cause people to become irritated with each other, to create codependency in the relationship, and/or to be overwhelmingly vulnerable to the negative energy of one another. 
■ A cord is a lower vibrational type of connection, and even cords that are created with good intentions (this is almost always subconscious) can become harmful. All cords should be removed, and instead, you can set the intention to facilitate a balanced and pure exchange of energy with others. 
■ Cords can attach anywhere on the body, but common locations are:
● The gut/navel
● The heart
● The brain
● The neck or back of the neck
● The genitals
■ The location may have interesting metaphysical significance, but is often not necessary to identify when decoding.
■ Some cords can have an open end, especially where the relationship with the other party was abruptly ended for some reason. This may create a vacuum, and the other end of the cord will likely attach to someone new who has a similar vibration to the original person.
■ When removing a cord, it may be helpful to focus on positive feelings for the other person, and remove other imbalances in an attempt to heal that relationship, whether it is current or in the past.

  static const String entityExp =
      '''An entity is a type of spirit/energy being that can affect the physical body, the energy body or the energy field/aura, potentially causing various problems.
■ There is likely a large range of entities, from the mildly irritating to more intensely negative and more capable of causing greater interference with health and balance.
■ There is no reason to fear entities any more than any other imbalance.
■ Follow the Intention procedure and you should always find success with removing any entity you find. 
■ Our experience indicates that entities have contributed to: 
● Fatigue
● Physical discomfort
● Negativity and mood issues
● Addiction
● Feeling like something is there that doesn’t belong
● Feeling stuck
● Feeling conflict or resistance coming from outside
● Self sabotage
● Anger at self
● Self doubt
● Mental illness symptoms
● Nightmares

  static const String postHypnoticExp =
      '''A post-hypnotic suggestion is a specific type of negative vibrational frequency, in the form of a statement, stuck in the subconscious mind. 
■ Post-hypnotic suggestions always come from outside sources and are not of your own creation. However, you may be vulnerable to specific vibrations depending on any associated imbalances that are also present. 
■ You can become vulnerable to post-hypnotic suggestions when exposed to specific types of repetitive music or other vibrations that desynchronize the cerebral hemispheres of the brain. This opens the subconscious mind to “suggestion,” much like being hypnotized. 
■ It is also possible that post-hypnotic suggestions may be trapped while sleeping, therefore, it is highly recommended to play only high vibrational music while sleeping. 
■ A post-hypnotic suggestion may come from an entity, a very negative person, or negative vibrations embedded in whatever music, video games, or other entertainment you were exposed to during the brain desynchronization period.
■ Post-hypnotic suggestions can potentially create troubling symptoms, such as: 
● Mood issues
● Dark thoughts 
● Self-harm 
● Addiction
● Anger at self
● Depression related feelings
■ Use the chart of Despair Anchors and Post-Hypnotic Suggestions to determine what the message is, or close to it. The chart is not exhaustive, and the actual vibration may be a little different. 
■ Use intuition and common sense when decoding. Keep in mind that this is an interpretation process—you may interpret the vibration a little differently than was originally stated. The key is getting close enough when decoding.

■ Most saboteurs are created by the subconscious mind and are the expression of negative feelings toward the recipient. 
■ Some saboteurs can be self-inflicted, usually if there is ongoing or intense self-abuse. 
■ Saboteurs may cause physical discomfort and interfere with the recovery process.

  static const String prionExp = '''
  Prions, or “proteinaceous infectious particles” are pathogenic particles containing misfolded proteins. Unlike other pathogens, prions do not replicate, but can trigger other normal proteins to also fold abnormally.

● The protein that prions are made of is called prion protein— this is a normal protein, and our DNA has a gene (PRNP) that tells our cells how to make it. This protein— known as PrPc in its healthy state— is capable of converting or misfolding and becoming pathogenic in nature— it then is known as PrPSc. 
● This conversion can occur for different reasons: spontaneously, due to a genetic mutation of the PRNP gene, or due to exposure to a prion from an external source.
● It may be possible for prions to be created by exposure to heavy metals in the body, via a process called metal ion catalysis or electrostatic catalysis, where metal ions trigger the change in the protein. 
● While prions do have the potential to create devastating neurological diseases (there is a high concentration of PrPc in the nervous system), it’s quite possible that many relatively healthy people have prions in their bodies as well, and the immune system is simply able to eliminate them before they can do much damage. 
● It is important to identify Associated imbalances when prions show up using The Body Code.

  static const String mirobiomeExp = '''
  The microbiome refers to the trillions of microorganisms that inhabit every individual, including bacteria, fungi, parasites and other organisms in the average adult, the total number of which rivals, or even surpasses our own cells. While most of these organisms live in our intestinal tract, every inch of our skin, and nearly every other area of our body is colonized as well. The microbiome affects our moods, communicates with our brain, and influences our immunity. Microbes can also bypass the brain, communicating directly to the enteric nervous system in the gut, affecting the way our digestive systems function. 

Research on the microbiome and how differences in people’s microbiomes can affect their health is ongoing. Implantation of organism-rich fecal samples from a healthier person to a person suffering from certain illnesses has been shown to have a dramatic effect. For example, fecal transplant therapy (known as fecal microbiota transplants, or FMT) is becoming the method of choice to treat potentially fatal infections of a bacteria called clostridium difficile. 

We have a symbiotic relationship with most of these organisms, and some of them are essential to our existence, such as the bacteria that help us to fight off harmful organisms, and that produce vitamin K and vitamin B12 in our gut.

The microbiome is a collective consciousness that can be communicated with through muscle testing and queried for answers, just as you would muscle test any other part of the body. 

We believe that the microbiome can have trapped emotions, as well as any other energetic imbalance that the body can harbor, and that these imbalances may even be inherited.

If you have been guided to this page by the subconscious mind through testing, it indicates that the microbiome is imbalanced in some way.

  The meridians are a concept of Ancient Chinese Medicine, and can be thought of as the energy network of the body. Life force energy, or Qi, along with blood and other body fluids flow along these pathways throughout the whole body. 

This energy flow creates balance within the body, helping our organs and other body parts to get what they need in order to function optimally, energetically and physically. 
The 12 Main Meridians are located symmetrically on both sides of the body (left and right), and each is linked to an internal organ. 
Each meridian also has a collateral channel, an extension of the meridian, which is located on the opposite side of the body. Imbalances often affect the collateral channel first, then the meridian, then the related organ or any other parts along the meridian. Imbalances in organ, meridian or collateral channel may manifest outwardly in the area of the collateral channel (e.g. rashes or discomfort).
A meridian may become imbalanced, usually when the energy flow is weakened or blocked by an associated imbalance. When imbalanced, any associated body parts located along that meridian may be impacted. 
Each meridian has a Yin-Yang counterpart, listed below. Each meridian and its counterpart are most active at certain times of the day or night—this is listed below as well as on the Diurnal Cycle chart (see Circuit or System Section). Imbalance in a meridian may create a disturbance in organ function, energy level, mood, or sleep during its most active time.

● This energy flow creates balance within the body, helping our organs and other body parts to get what they need in order to function optimally, energetically and physically. 
● The 12 Main Meridians are located symmetrically on both sides of the body (left and right), and each is linked to an internal organ. 
● Each meridian also has a collateral channel, an extension of the meridian, which is located on the opposite side of the body. Imbalances often affect the collateral channel first, then the meridian, then the related organ or any other parts along the meridian. Imbalances in organ, meridian or collateral channel may manifest outwardly in the area of the collateral channel (e.g. rashes or discomfort).
● A meridian may become imbalanced, usually when the energy flow is weakened or blocked by an associated imbalance. When imbalanced, any associated body parts located along that meridian may be impacted. 
● Each meridian has a Yin-Yang counterpart, listed below. Each meridian and its counterpart are most active at certain times of the day or night—this is listed below as well as on the Diurnal Cycle chart (see Circuit or System Section). Imbalance in a meridian may create a disturbance in organ function, energy level, mood, or sleep during its most active time. 
The lung meridian governs the flow of Taiyin (greater Yin), and runs from the chest, along the front arm and continues down to the hand.

  static const String cranialNerves = '''
  Cranial nerves emerge directly from the brain, in contrast to spinal nerves, which emerge from the spinal cord. The cranial nerves have different functions as shown briefly here:

● CN1: The olfactory nerve 
○ carries information from the upper part of the nasal sinuses directly into the brain, enabling our sense of smell.
● CN2: The optic nerve 
○ transmits information into the brain enabling sight.
● CN3: The oculomotor nerve 
○ controls the muscles of the eyes enabling us to move our eyes as well as constrict our pupils and adjust our lenses to view objects both close up and at a distance.
● CN4: The trochlear nerve
○ also involved with eye movement, controlling a muscle that allows our eyes to point downward and inward.
● CN5: The trigeminal nerve 
○ the largest nerve of all the cranial nerves, helping in chewing, clenching the teeth and giving sensation to the muscles and to the eardrum. In addition, the trigeminal nerve gives sensation to parts of the face, sinuses, lower teeth, tongue, etc. Trigeminal neuralgia is a disorder of this nerve that can cause intense discomfort as well as facial tics.
● CN6: The abducens nerve 
○ also helps control eye movements, enabling sideways glances.
● CN7: The facial nerve 
○ made up of four different nerve centers that control the muscles of facial expression, the sensation of taste, external ear sensation and certain facial glands.
● CN8: The vestibulocochlear nerve
○ involved with both hearing and maintaining balance.
● CN9: The glossopharyngeal nerve 
○ enables taste sensation from the back of the tongue, as well as sensory information from the back of the throat, the tonsils, and middle ear, and also is involved with enabling the throat to shorten and widen.
● CN10: The vagus nerve is the longest of all the nerves, as it starts in the brain and ends in the abdomen. The vagus nerve provides many functions, including regulating heart rhythm and connecting to the smooth muscles in the lungs, airway, and the gastrointestinal tract. The vagus nerve also provides sensation to the throat, heart, abdominal organs and the outer part of the ear, and also helps with our ability to taste. In addition, the vagus nerve enables movement of the throat and soft palate. 
● CN11: The accessory nerve
○ connects to muscles in the neck that enable rotation, extension and flexion of the neck and shoulders
● CN12: The hypoglossal nerve 
○ connects to the muscles of the tongue enabling movement of the tongue.

  General information:

● Chinese medicine recognizes six "pernicious influences" also known as the six pathogenic factors, six excesses, or six evils. This usually comes from being exposed to or overwhelmed by the element via weather or environmental exposure, from diet, and could also be created by internal factors, such as associated imbalances or chronic illness. 
● Each of these is simply the energy of an element, but an excess of it is considered toxic by the subconscious mind. If the body is unable to process the energy, the flow of Qi (energy) may be imbalanced and symptoms may arise, sometimes even years later. Like the elements in our environment, these could combine within the body to create exacerbated symptoms (e.g. Cold and Wind together may feel more extreme than either element would on its own). For more information, research Chinese Medicine Theory.
Summer Heat energy possesses the qualities of scorching hot heat in nature, and is more intense than Heat energy. 

● It is a Yang energy.
● This is always external, created by exposure to intense summertime heat that overwhelmed the body and caused heat stroke. 
● It depletes bodily fluids and Qi, and can create high fever, dizziness, nausea, lethargy, thirst, blurred vision, headache, profuse sweating, fainting, and exhaustion.

  Genetically modified organisms or genetically modified foods are bioengineered foods produced from organisms that have had changes introduced to their DNA.  These genetic changes are usually introduced for agricultural reasons.  The two most common DNA changes are: the organism produces pesticides from within itself, or to be pesticide tolerant.

  General information:

● Chinese medicine recognizes six "pernicious influences" also known as the six pathogenic factors, six excesses, or six evils. This usually comes from being exposed to or overwhelmed by the element via weather or environmental exposure, from diet, and could also be created by internal factors, such as associated imbalances or chronic illness. 
● Each of these is simply the energy of an element, but an excess of it is considered toxic by the subconscious mind. If the body is unable to process the energy, the flow of Qi (energy) may be imbalanced and symptoms may arise, sometimes even years later. Like the elements in our environment, these could combine within the body to create exacerbated symptoms (e.g. Cold and Wind together may feel more extreme than either element would on its own). For more information, research Chinese Medicine Theory.
Wind energy is considered to be the most damaging and chaotic, because it possesses the qualities of wind in nature. It exerts excess forceful, unpredictable movement of energy in the body. 

● It is a Yang energy.
● This is created by exposure to wind in the environment, or may be caused internally by liver imbalance. 
● It often affects the head, throat, eyes, upper body, and lungs, and can potentially create shaking or spasms, or symptoms that change unpredictably. 
● This may cause one to be physically sensitive to or emotionally agitated by wind in the environment (even when one is indoors).
● Often has at least one associated imbalance, especially the other five pernicious influences. ''';

Heat energy possesses the qualities of heat or fire in nature. It exerts increased activity and too much movement of Qi in the body. It is the opposite element of dampness.

● It is a Yang energy.
● This is created by exposure to heat in the environment, or may be caused internally by Liver, Stomach or Heart imbalance. It can also be created by intense emotions such as Anger. Other causes may be hot foods, alcohol, coffee, fried foods or red meat. 
● It often affects the skin and can potentially create itchiness and rashes, as well as inflammation, fever, thirst, dehydration, constipation, and aversion to heat. Heat may create feelings of restlessness, agitation and even aggression. May create spasms especially when combined with wind.  
● May produce wind energy when heat imbalances the liver. ''';

Dryness energy possesses the qualities of dryness in nature. It is closely related to heat. 

● It is a Yang energy.
● This is created by exposure to a dry climate or lack of humidity in the environment. It can also be caused by dehydration, smoking, or lack of bodily fluids, or excess spicy hot foods.
● It often affects the lungs, skin, hair and mucous membranes. It can potentially create physical discomfort, respiratory problems, as well as chronic dehydration and associated symptoms such as thirst.
● CAUSES: This may cause one to be sensitive to dryness in the environment, especially when cold, heat or wind is also present.''';

● Cold energy possesses the same qualities of cold in nature, slowing down movement and creating stagnation in the body. 

● It is a Yin energy.
● This is created by exposure to cold in the environment, eating too much cold food, or caused internally by spleen, stomach or kidneys imbalance.
● It may be imbalancing to the muscles, lungs and skin, causing contractions, headaches, stiff neck and upper body, little to no sweating, and clear nasal mucous. 
● The symptoms created by cold energy may be relieved by warmth.
● This may cause one to have trouble staying warm.''';

  Free radicals are unstable atoms due to a missing paired electron. These are highly reactive and short lived. They are naturally occurring and a byproduct of our metabolism, but become problematic when we develop them in excess or are unable to deal with them properly.

● The effect of free radicals in the body can essentially be described as “rusting” in the body.
